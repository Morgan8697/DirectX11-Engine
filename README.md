## After learning how to build a renderer using ray-tracing (Graphics repo) im diving into DirectX11 implementation

### 1. Learn how to manage windows and messages (with WindowsAPI...)
### 2. Build a window instantiation framework.
   2.1 Wrap window instantiation in a class
   
   2.2 Build an IO Event Manager (Mouse, keyboard)
